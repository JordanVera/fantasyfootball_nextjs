      <p>
        NFL Last Longer is the first and only exclusively cryptocurrency
        survivor league style pool for the National Football League. The
        objective is to pick one NFL team to win each week, no Vegas points
        spread, and you cannot pick the same team more than once through out the
        season. We take pride in being innovators in this field by supporting
        cryptocurrency EXCLUSIVELY.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you make an account you will have access to the dashboard by
        signing in, this is where you can buy into the last longer and make your
        weekly picks! Please make sure to pick a solid password. Once you are
        logged into the account you can reset your password, unfortunately you
        cannot reset your password while not logged out.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Each user is allowed up to 20 entries, which should give you plenty of
        attempts at going long and out lasting the entire pool, good luck! We
        hope we have created an awesome app for our users but if you have any
        suggestions you can always contact us and we'd be happy to hear your
        feedback.{' '}
